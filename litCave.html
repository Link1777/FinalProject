    With the torch lit you can see a treacherous cliff with a small walkway going further into the cave.<br>
    As you make your way further into the cave the noise begins to become louder.<br>
    Upon entering the last parts of the cave you encounter a giant one eyed monster.<br>
    What do you do?
